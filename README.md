Interactive Self-Supervised Pansharpening Network Guided by Joint Satellite Data and Intermediate Loss

 
﻿Paper Status: Under submission. Code will be released upon paper acceptance.

 
Overview

 
This repository will host the implementation of the interactive self-supervised pansharpening network guided by joint satellite datasets and intermediate loss once the manuscript is accepted for publication.

 
Method

 
This method proposes an interactive self-supervised pansharpening network (ISPN) guided by joint satellite datasets and intermediate loss, which integrates prior-guided spatial-spectral streams and employs joint satellite datasets with intermediate loss to enhance generalization and improve spectral and spatial consistency.

 
﻿ Code Availability

 
﻿ The code and scripts will be made publicly available on this GitHub repository as soon as we receive an acceptance notification from the journal/conference.
